As for fever, there is a variation of forms used, from liquid, tablets to others. \n\n**Notes**\nWhat is the difference between capsules and tablets?\nTablets are entirely composed of medication, while capsules only contain medication inside the shell. And there's the fact that capsules can't be crushed or split, while tablets often can.

Summary\nIn this analysis process, we have managed to discover the top drugs used in the most common occuring conditions: fever, backpain and hypertension.\n\nWe also learned that there is positive correlations between the ratings variable, effective, satisfaction and ease of use. This makes a sense because, the more effective a drug is at relieving pain/symptons of a certain condition, the more satisfied the user will be. Apart from that, the ease of use also affects the satisfaction level of the drug.\n\nBy putting the number of reviews into consideration, we are able to gain more insight on which drug has more reliability in overall effectiveness that is also maintained through a greater number of users, rather than just one or two users. A low number of reviews for a medication may not necessarily reflect its quality or effectiveness. It could be due to various factors, including the medication's newness, limited availability, or niche use. When considering a medication with a low number of reviews, it's essential to consult with healthcare professionals, consider other sources of information, and evaluate the available evidence to make an informed decision about its suitability for a particular condition or individual.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
